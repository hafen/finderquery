# tonality:"-4"
# search for rssitems with a positive tonality

# tonality:[1 TO *]


# **DEFAULTS**

# Unless they are specified, every request on this Finder installation gets added the following default parameters.

# Publication date
# if you don't specify it, Finder adds a clause on publication date (see here), as filter parameter, to limit the search to the whole day of today and the previous 30 days.

# fq=pubdate:[NOW/DAY-30DAY TO *]
# Start and Rows
# if you don't specify it, Finder adds two parameters (see here), to return just the first 10 rows.

# start=0 rows=10

# **SYNTAX**

# Finder uses the standard Solr syntax. You can read more here. Read also the Fields section, which provides several examples of the standard Solr syntax, per each field. As regards operators, you can read more here. As regards the syntax for nested objects, you can read more here.

# Clauses
# This clause selects all documents.

# *:*
# Operators
# No operator
# No operator   makes the clause that follows optional (this is the default).

# search for rssitems with category brussels, or with category CRIME, or with category EmmPanorama

# category:brussels category:CRIME category:EmmPanorama
# category:(brussels CRIME EmmPanorama)
# The operator +
# The operator + makes the clause that follows required.

# search for rssitems with all the given categories

# +category:brussels +category:CRIME +category:EmmPanorama
# category:(+brussels +CRIME +EmmPanorama)
# The operator -
# The operator - makes the clause that follows prohibited.

# search for rssitems with category brussels, and with category CRIME, and without category EmmPanorama

# +category:brussels +category:CRIME -category:EmmPanorama
# category:(+brussels +CRIME -EmmPanorama)
# Queries on nested objects
# This special syntax is needed to enforce a clause on a field (or several fields) belonging to a nested object. Such clause can obviously be paired with a clause (or more) on the parent object. As of today, Finder indexes two objects as nested objects: quotes and timex. One rssitem (the parent) can infact have zero, one or more quotes (its nested objects), and zero, one or more timex ranges (its nested objects).

# search for rssitems from country DE with zero quotes

# +country:DE -{!parent which=language:*}quotewho:*
# search for rssitems with a quote either from entityid 2 (quote who) or about entityid 2 (quote about)

# URLdecode("%7B!parent%20which%3Dlanguage%3A*%7D(quotewho%3A2%20quoteabout%3A2)")

# {!parent which=language:*}(quotewho:2 quoteabout:2)
# search for rssitems with category Agriculture, with a quote from entityid 2 (quote who), whose quote text is associated with category CRIME and contains the keyword european
# note: the clause on category Agriculture is defined as fq probably because of a solr bug

# **PARAMETERS**

# These are the main Solr's common query parameters. You can read more here or here.

# Query filter
# Define the clauses of your search that could be reused as filters through fq. These will be cached for subsequent same calls. Filter uses the same syntax of query. More than one filter can be specified.

# fq=pubdate:[NOW/DAY-30DAY TO *] fq=language:(de en fr)
# Basic paging
# Specify an offset at which Solr should begin displaying content through start, and control how many rows of responses are returned through rows. By default offset starts at 0 and the first 10 rows are returned.

# start=0 rows=10
# Deep paging with a cursor
# Include guid in the sort parameter, control how many rows of responses are returned through rows, specify cursorMark=* for the first request and cursorMark=<nextCursorMark> for the next requests. You can read more here.

# sort=pubdate desc,guid asc rows=10 cursorMark=*
# sort=pubdate desc,guid asc rows=15 cursorMark=AoJRfSVib29rNw==
# Sorting
# Arrange search results in either ascending (asc) or descending (desc) order through sort.

# sort=pubdate desc
# Maximum time allowed
# Constraint the time allowed for the query to be processed through timeAllowed (in milliseconds). If this time expires before the search is complete, any partial results will be returned. A value of 0 means no time restriction.

# timeAllowed=60000
# Query debug
# Debug the execution of a query through debugQuery in conjunction with native. Native can be used as well on its own to pass-through Finder.

# debugQuery=true native=true
# Query caching
# Let Solr avoid caching the query results through cache.

# cache=false


# **FACETING**

# These are the parameters for Solr's faceting. You can read more here.

# Examples of faceting

# **EXTRA**

# These are some extra parameters provided by Finder.

# Leading
# Exclude duplicate rssitems from the results.
# More precisely: post-process the results of your search, so that only one rssitem per group is returned; group being the leading rssitem and its duplicates, as settled by the duplicate detection component. This functionality may not be available for rssitems indexed before January 2016.

# leading=true
# Within each group, return the oldest rssitem.
# leading=true group.sort=pubdate asc







# No operator   makes the clause that follows optional (this is the default).

# search for rssitems with category brussels, or with category CRIME, or with category EmmPanorama

# category:brussels category:CRIME category:EmmPanorama
# category:(brussels CRIME EmmPanorama)
# The operator +
# The operator + makes the clause that follows required.

# search for rssitems with all the given categories
